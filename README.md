## Home, Home Alone: A Machine Learning Approach to Tackle Inefficiencies in the Real Estate Market
=========================

### Project Overview:

#### Problem Area:
There are many challenges within the real estate market. We can take a look at the challenges faced by both sides: sellers who are listing new properties and buyers who are looking to acquire new properties. Some of the main problems faced by buyers include: housing affordability, limited inventory, emotional stress and decision fatigue, and location constraints. Some of the main problems faced by sellers are unused inventory, poor marketing, and volatile markets. Furthermore, the Covid pandemic largely affected both sides of the housing market, creating instability in the median prices of properties. 

#### Users affected:
The users in the United States directly affected by this problem are individuals/families that are looking to purchase a property as well as the sellers (in our case interested in the real estate agents) that have listed a new property for sale. 

#### Proposed Data Science solution:
Given a sufficiently large dataset, one can deeply analyze the housing market in the United States over the most recent decade, determine key patterns in terms of inventory, prices across property types, and demand (number of properties sold) across different regions, and use machine learning to make predictions about these variables in the future.

#### The impact of my solution:
Improving the accuracy of a machine learning model with the goal of significantly surpassing baseline accuracy across predicting inventory, property sale prices, and number of property sales would greatly serve millions of buyers and sellers in the United States, potentially generating hundreds of millions of dollars by making better use of inventory resources, marketing strategies, and decreased number of pending sales. 


#### Description of dataset:
The raw data set was attained from Kaggle.com and it was gathered by Redfin, a real estate brokerage company with an online platform connecting users to listed properties as well as real estate agents. The data set is freqently updated with ranges between 2012 and early 2024. Additionally, it contains over 5 million rows and 58 columns. 

After preprocessing here are the columns of interest:

### Organization

The largest portion of time was allocated to cleaning the data.
The raw data set contained over 5,000,000 rows that had null values. The strategy of imputing by the mean was used after considering which columns had nulls. Further processing was required to check for duplicates, come up with more features (by combining the features given from the data set) in hopes to gain deeper insights, taking into consideration inflation, gathering data on political leanings of states (to assess possible relationship of political party majorities in the senates with the features from the data set), grouping original locations by regions in the United States, excluding outliers, and removing highly correlated features to take care of multicollinearity.

After this, two linear regression models were implemented to predict number of homes sold and median sale price. R^2 values of .75 and .85 were attained.

Further models were used for the two variables above:
KNN Regression
Neural Net
PCA
