## Home, Home Alone: A Machine Learning Approach to Tackle Inefficiencies in the Real Estate Market
=========================

### Project Overview:

#### Problem Area:
There are many problems within the real estate market. We can take a look at the challenges faced by both sides: sellers who are listing new properties and buyers who are looking to acquire new properties.

#### Users affected:
The

#### Proposed Data Science solution:

#### Description of dataset:

#### Key takeaways

### Demo

... Show your work:
...     Data visualizations
...     Interactive demo (e.g., `streamlit` app)
...     Short video of users trying out the solution


### Methodology

... High-level diagrams of entire process:
...     various data processing steps
...     various modelling directions
...     various prototyping directions


### Organization

#### Repository 

* `data` 
    - contains link to copy of the dataset (stored in a publicly accessible cloud storage)
    - saved copy of aggregated / processed data as long as those are not too large (> 10 MB)

* `model`
    - `joblib` dump of final model(s)

* `notebooks`
    - contains all final notebooks involved in the project

* `docs`
    - contains final report, presentations which summarize the project

* `references`
    - contains papers / tutorials used in the project

* `src`
    - Contains the project source code (refactored from the notebooks)

* `.gitignore`
    - Part of Git, includes files and folders to be ignored by Git version control

* `conda.yml`
    - Conda environment specification

* `README.md`
    - Project landing page (this page)

* `LICENSE`
